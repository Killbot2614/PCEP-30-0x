<h1 align="center"> PCEP-30-0x: Python Essentials 1</h1>

This repository contains my work and exercises for the **PCEP - Certified Entry-Level Python Programmer** certification, offered by the Python Institute.

# Overview

The **PCEP certification** validates foundational knowledge of programming concepts and the Python programming language. This repository includes notes, exercises, and resources aligned with the certification syllabus.

# About The Certification
<p>
PCEP™ – Certified Entry-Level Python Programmer certification (Exam PCEP-30-0x) is a professional credential that measures the candidate's ability to accomplish coding tasks related to the essentials of programming in the Python language. A test candidate should demonstrate sufficient knowledge of the universal concepts of computer programming, the syntax and semantics of the Python language, as well as the skills in resolving typical implementation challenges with the help of the Python Standard Library.

<p>
The PCEP™ certification shows that the individual is familiar with the following concepts: fundamental terms and definitions (e.g. compilation vs. interpretation), Python's logic and structure (e.g. keywords, instructions, indentation), literals, variables, and numeral systems, operators and data types, I/O operations, control flow mechanisms (conditional blocks and loops), data collections (lists, tuples, dictionaries, strings), functions (decomposition, built-in and user-defined functions, organizing interaction between functions and their environment, generators, recursion), exceptions (exception handling, hierarchies), as well as the essentials of Python programming language syntax, semantics, and the runtime environment.

# Topics

**Computer Programming and Python Fundamentals**
- **PCEP-30-02 1.1** – Fundamental Terms and Definitions  
  Concepts like interpreting and compilation are covered, with a focus on the role of the interpreter and compiler. Additionally, distinctions are made between lexis, syntax, and semantics in programming.
- **PCEP-30-02 1.2** – Python’s Logic and Structure  
  Introduces keywords, instructions, indentation, and comments, all crucial for structuring Python code effectively.
- **PCEP-30-02 1.3** – Literals and Variables, Numeral Systems  
  Discusses booleans, integers, floating-point numbers, and scientific notation. It also explores string handling, different numeral systems (binary, octal, decimal, hexadecimal), variable declaration, naming conventions, and implementing PEP-8 recommendations.
- **PCEP-30-02 1.4** – Operators and Data Types  
  Covers numeric operators (`* / % // + -`), string operators (`* +`), assignment and shortcut operators, unary and binary operators, as well as bitwise (`~ & ^ | << >>`) and boolean (`not, and, or`) operators. Also includes relational operators (`== != > >= < <=`), floating-point accuracy considerations, and type casting.
- **PCEP-30-02 1.5** – Input/Output Console Operations  
  Explains the usage of functions like `print()`, `input()`, and the customization of outputs with `sep=`, `end=`, along with casting inputs to integer or float types using `int()` and `float()`.

**Control Flow - Conditional Blocks and Loops**
- **PCEP-30-02 2.1** – Make Decisions with `if`  
  Focuses on using conditional statements such as `if`, `if-else`, `if-elif`, and `if-elif-else`. It also includes nested conditional statements and handling multiple conditions.
- **PCEP-30-02 2.2** – Perform Iterations  
  Introduces loop structures like `while` and `for`, as well as functions like `range()` and `in`. Covers controlling flow in loops using `break`, `continue`, and expanding loop constructs with `while-else` and `for-else`.

**Data Collections, Tuples, Dictionaries, Lists, Strings**
- **PCEP-30-02 3.1** – Lists  
  Discusses constructing vectors, indexing, and slicing lists. Key functions like `len()`, `sorted()`, list methods (`append()`, `insert()`, `index()`), and iterating through lists using `for`. Also covers list comprehensions, copying/cloning lists, and working with nested lists (matrices, cubes).
- **PCEP-30-02 3.2** – Tuples  
  Covers the immutable nature of tuples, differences between tuples and lists, and working with indexing, slicing, and nesting lists and tuples.
- **PCEP-30-02 3.3** – Dictionaries  
  Focuses on building, indexing, and modifying dictionaries, adding/removing keys, and iterating through dictionaries. Discusses dictionary methods like `keys()`, `items()`, and `values()`.
- **PCEP-30-02 3.4** – Strings  
  Explores string immutability, indexing, slicing, escaping characters with `\`, handling quotes and apostrophes inside strings, and working with multi-line strings. It also introduces basic string methods and functions.

**Functions and Exceptions**
- **PCEP-30-02 4.1** – Functions  
  Explains function definition and invocation, the role of the `return` keyword, and recursion. Also covers the use of the `None` keyword in function returns.
- **PCEP-30-02 4.2** – Function Interaction  
  Focuses on the difference between parameters and arguments, how to pass positional, keyword, or mixed arguments, and setting default parameter values. Also addresses name scopes, shadowing, and the use of the `global` keyword.
- **PCEP-30-02 4.3** – Python Built-In Exceptions  
  Introduces built-in exceptions such as `BaseException`, `SystemExit`, `KeyboardInterrupt`, and other common errors like `ArithmeticError`, `IndexError`, `KeyError`, `TypeError`, and `ValueError`.
- **PCEP-30-02 4.4** – Exception Handling  
  Covers `try-except` blocks for error handling, the order of `except` branches, and propagating exceptions through function boundaries. It also discusses delegating responsibility for handling exceptions.
