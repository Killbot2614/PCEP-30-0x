<h1 align="center"> PCEP-30-0x: Python Essentials 1 </h1>

This repository contains my work and exercises for the **PCEP - Certified Entry-Level Python Programmer** certification, offered by the Python Institute.

## Overview

The **PCEP certification** validates foundational knowledge of programming concepts and the Python programming language. This repository includes notes, exercises, and resources aligned with the certification syllabus.

### Key Topics Covered

- **Computer Programming and Python Fundamentals (18%)**
  - Fundamental terms and definitions: interpreting and the interpreter, compilation and the compiler, lexis, syntax, and semantics
  - Python’s logic and structure: keywords, instructions, indentation, comments
  - Literals and variables: Boolean, integers, floating-point numbers, scientific notation, strings, numeral systems (binary, octal, decimal, hexadecimal), naming conventions, PEP-8 recommendations
  - Operators and data types: numeric, string, assignment, unary, binary, bitwise, Boolean operators, relational operators, type casting
  - Input/Output operations: `print()`, `input()`, and related functions

- **Control Flow (29%)**
  - Conditional statements: `if`, `if-else`, `if-elif`, nesting conditional statements
  - Iteration: `for` and `while` loops, controlling loop execution with `break` and `continue`, expanding loops with `while-else` and `for-else`

- **Data Collections (25%)**
  - Lists: constructing, indexing, slicing, list methods, comprehensions, iterating through lists
  - Tuples: indexing, slicing, immutability, differences between tuples and lists
  - Dictionaries: building, indexing, adding/removing keys, iterating through keys and values
  - Strings: constructing, indexing, slicing, escaping characters, basic string functions

- **Functions and Exceptions (28%)**
  - Functions: defining, invoking, recursion, the `return` keyword, parameters vs. arguments
  - Exception handling: Python built-in exceptions hierarchy, using `try`, `except`, and `finally` blocks
